Architecture Overview
ML Pipeline Flow
This project implements a complete MLOps pipeline with two distinct phases:

Training Pipeline (scripts/run_pipeline.py):

Data Loading → Data Validation (Great Expectations) → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → XGBoost Training → MLflow Logging
All artifacts (model, feature columns, preprocessing logic) are stored in MLflow for reproducibility
Serving Pipeline (src/app/main.py + src/serving/inference.py):

FastAPI REST API (/predict endpoint) + Gradio Web UI (/ui endpoint) → MLflow Model Loading → Feature Transformation → Prediction
Feature processing mirrors training-time transformations for consistency
MLflow Integration Patterns
Experiment Name: "Telco Churn" (default, can be overridden)
Tracking URI: File-based at {project_root}/mlruns
Logged Artifacts: model/, feature_columns.txt, preprocessing.pkl
Tracked Metrics: precision, recall, f1, roc_auc, train_time, pred_time, data_quality_pass
Parameters: model type, threshold (default 0.35), test_size (default 0.2)
Feature Engineering Consistency
Critical pattern: Training and serving must use identical feature transformations.

Training (src/features/build_features.py):

Binary features (Yes/No, Male/Female) → deterministic 0/1 mapping
Multi-category features → one-hot encoding with drop_first=True
Boolean columns → integers
Serving (src/serving/inference.py):

Uses fixed BINARY_MAP dictionary for consistent binary encoding
Applies pd.get_dummies() with same parameters as training
Feature alignment via FEATURE_COLS from training artifacts
Model Loading and Serving
Container Path: Model loaded from /app/model (MLflow pyfunc format)
Feature Order: Enforced using feature_columns.txt from training
Prediction Format: Returns "Likely to churn" or "Not likely to churn" strings
Data Validation
Tool: Great Expectations with custom validation suite
Location: src/utils/validate_data.py
Checks: CustomerID presence, gender values, numeric ranges for tenure/charges
Integration: Results logged to MLflow as data_quality_pass metric
Docker Containerization
Base Image: python:3.11-slim
Key Setting: PYTHONPATH=/app/src for proper module imports
Model Artifacts: Specific MLflow run copied to /app/model during build
Serving: uvicorn with FastAPI app on port 8000
CI/CD Pipeline
Trigger: Push to main branch
Actions: Build Docker image → Push to Docker Hub (anasriad8/telco-fastapi:latest)
Requirements: DOCKERHUB_USERNAME and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN secrets
Deployment: Manual ECS service update (AWS Fargate + ALB)
Key Implementation Details
XGBoost Model Configuration
Optimized hyperparameters are hardcoded in scripts/run_pipeline.py:100-110:

n_estimators=301, learning_rate=0.034, max_depth=7
scale_pos_weight calculated dynamically for class imbalance handling
API Endpoints
GET / - Health check returning {"status": "ok"}
POST /predict - Accepts CustomerData Pydantic model with 18 customer attributes
/ui - Gradio interface mounted via gr.mount_gradio_app()
File System Layout
data/raw/ - Original datasets
data/processed/ - Cleaned datasets
mlruns/ - MLflow experiment tracking database
artifacts/ - Shared preprocessing artifacts (feature_columns.json, preprocessing.pkl)
src/serving/model/ - Local MLflow run copies for development
Development Notes
No formal test suite exists; use manual test scripts in scripts/test_*.py
MLflow UI can be accessed with: mlflow ui --backend-store-uri file:./mlruns
The project uses file-based MLflow tracking (not a tracking server)
Model serving expects exact feature column order from training time
