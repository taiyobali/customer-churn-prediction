Telco Churn – End-to-End ML Project
Purpose
Build and ship a full machine-learning solution for predicting customer churn in a telecom setting—from data prep and modeling to an API + web UI deployed on AWS.

Problem solved & benefits
Faster decisions: Predicts which customers are likely to churn so teams can act before they leave.
Operationalized ML: Model is accessible via a REST API and a simple UI; anyone can test it without notebooks.
Repeatable delivery: CI/CD + containers mean every change can be rebuilt, tested, and redeployed in a consistent way.
Traceable experiments: MLflow tracks runs, metrics, and artifacts for reproducibility and auditing.
What I built
Data & Modeling: Feature engineering + XGBoost classifier; experiments logged to MLflow.
Model tracking: Runs, metrics, and the serialized model logged under a named MLflow experiment.
Inference service: FastAPI app exposing /predict (POST) and a root health check /.
Web UI: Gradio interface mounted at /ui for quick, shareable manual testing.
Containerization: Docker image with uvicorn entrypoint (src.app.main:app) listening on port 8000.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions builds the image and pushes to Docker Hub; optionally triggers an ECS service update.
Orchestration: AWS ECS Fargate runs the container (serverless).
Networking: Application Load Balancer (ALB) on HTTP:80 forwarding to a Target Group (IP targets on HTTP:8000).
Security: Security groups scoped to allow ALB inbound 80 from the internet, and task inbound 8000 from the ALB SG.
Observability: CloudWatch Logs for container stdout/stderr and ECS service events.
Deployment flow (high-level)
Push to main → GitHub Actions builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.
ECS service is updated (manually or via the workflow) to force a new deployment.
ALB health checks hit / on port 8000; once healthy, traffic is routed to the new task.
Users call POST /predict or open the Gradio UI at /ui via the ALB DNS.
Roadblocks & how we solved them
Unhealthy targets behind ALB

Cause: App didn’t respond at the health-check path; listener/target port mismatches.
Fixes: Added GET / health endpoint; confirmed ALB listener on 80 forwards to TG on 8000; TG health check path set to /.
Module import error in container (ModuleNotFoundError: serving)

Cause: Python path in the image didn’t include src/.
Fixes: Set PYTHONPATH=/app/src in the Dockerfile; corrected uvicorn app path to src.app.main:app.
ALB DNS timing out

Cause: Security group rules not aligned with traffic flow.
Fixes: ALB SG allows inbound 80 from 0.0.0.0/0; task SG allows inbound 8000 from the ALB SG; outbound open.
ECS redeploy not picking up the new image

Cause: Service still running previous task definition.
Fixes: Force new deployment (CLI or console) after pushing the new image; optional step added to CI.
Gradio UI error (“No runs found in experiment”)

Cause: Inference/UI expected an MLflow-logged model but couldn’t resolve a run.
Fixes: Standardized MLflow experiment name and model logging in training; inference loads the logged model consistently (and a local path for dev).
Local testing vs. prod paths

Cause: MLflow artifact URIs differ locally vs. in container.
Fixes: For local dev, load via direct ./mlruns/.../artifacts/model; in prod, container loads the packaged model path used at build time.
